# Milestone 4 Reflection - Group 19

- Overall, our group is very pleased with the final product. Our app functions well, with all prior bugs being fixed, and even more features being added. This production-ready version of the app meets and exceeds the needs of our users, as defined in our user persona profiles.

## Whatâ€™s been implemented:
We have implemented final updates and bug fixes to deploy a production-ready app:
- Layout updates include: 
    - Aesthetic changes to make using the app more intuitive.
    - Structural updates to all tab pages to fix bugs and address peer and TA feedback.
    - Implementation of a testing framework.
    - CI/CD implementation.
    - Final app deployment on shinyapps.io.
    - All documentation updated.

## What was not implemented:
- Some peer feedback was not implemented if it was not practical or not viable. 
    - For example, some peer feedback was to add the ability to view multiple summary statistics on the chloropleth map at once. This is not possible with a chloropleth, where color is based on one feature value.
    - Another example was the feedback giver misinterpreted
- Some minor aesthetic changes could be updated to give the app a truly polished look, such as optimized color schemes, etc.
    - However, the time spent on these activities may have diminishing returns, and the main deliverables have been met as is.

## Reflection on Peer and TA feedback
- The peer and TA feedback was essential for improvement of the app. Without feedback and peer review, our app would have fewer features, and may not effectively address the needs of our users (as defined in the personas). The feedback gave our group valuable insight into how our users actually used the app, and helped us find issues we could not find on our own.

### Has it been easy to use your app?
- Based on the peer feedback received for Milestone 3, most of the users felt the app was easy to use.
- Users found that the app achieved the persona-specific goals set out in the project proposal.
- Some users were able to identify bugs in the app, which affected the ease of use of the app.
    - All bugs have been addressed in our latest update.
- Via peer feedback, we were also given other suggestions, such as structural and aesthetic edits, that could improve the ease of use.
    - Viable suggestions were implemented. If suggestions could not be implemented, our group found a way to best address the intent behind each recommendation.

### Reoccurring themes feedback on what is good and what can be improved?
- Generally, feedback on our app was quite positive. Most pieces of feedback were unique and addressed different aspects of the app.
- In a very general sense, most feedback addressed usability improvements, such as removing bugs that occured under various feature selections, as well as minor aesthetic updates.

### Is there any feedback (or other insight) that you have found particularly valuable during your dashboard development?
- One piece of feedback received from the peer reviews was very helpful to give our group an insight into the user's needs. It was suggested that we add extra contextual information about the area surrounding each permit on the permit point map. The intent was to understand the composition of the surrounding area: neighbouring businesses, street names, proximity to services, etc. 
    - From a data perspective, this would have been a complex and time-consuming addition. Luckily, our group found a creative solution: we added two additional basemap options to the point map: a satellite view and a descriptive basemap (called Neighbourhood). These basemaps allow users to see adjacent properties and features without the need for additional spatial data layers.

## Conclusion

1. Our users all agree, our app is helpful for improving accessibility to Vancouver's building permit data!
2. The Vancouver Buiding Permit Explorer app was a success story for creativity and iterative design!
